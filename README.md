In the folder "Class 2", there is a file called "Typical_Employee_Survey_Data.xlsx". 

In R Studio, you will see an option to import Excel files under the file section. Use that option. Make sure you deselect the "first row as names" checkbox since your file does not have headers. 

You will write R functions to 


1. Print out the 5-point summary and boxplot (numerical columns) for each column (20 points)

2. Convert the columns that need to be converted to Factors (20 points)

3. Plot the right visual for each column (20 points)

4. Plot scatter plots to show few relationships (20 points)

5. Submit the homework (rmd and HTML file) in GitHub (20 points)
